Completely redesign my portfolio website to look visually stunning, futuristic, vibrant, and highly interactive.
Do NOT keep the current basic layout. Rebuild it with a modern, premium UI that looks like a high-end creative developer's site.

1. Overall Theme & Style

Use a vibrant blue-based futuristic theme with glowing gradients, soft neon edges, and smooth depth shadows.

Add micro-animations, hover effects, smooth transitions, and subtle parallax.

Make everything feel alive, energetic, and premium.

2. Navigation Bar

Create a clean, modern, transparent navbar with:

Logo on the left

Menu links aligned right

Slight glassmorphism blur

Hover glow animation

3. Hero Section

Rebuild the hero section to be dynamic and visually impressive:

Add a horizontal auto-sliding carousel of images showing satisfied clients using my delivered websites on their laptops, phones, or tablets.

Ensure the images feel authentic and modern.

Add a bold title similar to “CODEWITHRODRICK — Web Developer & Designer”.

Add subtext describing what I offer.

Add strong call-to-action buttons:

View Projects

Let’s chat through WhatsApp (+2349046490562) — make this button stand out with a WhatsApp green accent glow.

4. Featured Projects Section

Use a modern grid layout

Add placeholder futuristic cards with animations, shadows, and image previews

Remove any empty or plain appearance. Add sample thumbnails if needed.

5. About Section

Replace the plain blue circle profile with a professional, glowing, semi-transparent bust silhouette in blue tones.

Make the section more visually creative with smooth diagonal shapes, ambient light effects, floating icons, and a more compact, modern typography layout.

6. Skills & Expertise

Turn the skill tags into glowing pill-shaped badges

Add small animated icons

Add subtle section transitions

7. Contact Section

Make it vibrant instead of plain white

Add glowing border fields, soft glassmorphism background, and subtle animations

Add a large WhatsApp CTA button:
“Let’s chat through WhatsApp — +2349046490562”

Add animated social icons

8. Footer

Make it more modern, darker or gradient-based

Add soft neon text glow

9. Performance

Ensure all visuals do not break functionality

Keep layout responsive

Ensure animations are smooth

10. Quality

The entire website should look premium, futuristic, structured, vibrant, and visually stunning — something impressive and not basic.
